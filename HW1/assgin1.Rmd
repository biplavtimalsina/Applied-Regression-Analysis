## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## i. DataCamp: Introduction to R [30 points]
Please complete the course an Introduction to R. You should have received an email with an invitation link. Please email me if you did not. If you already know R, please talk to me in class and follow up with an email to opt out. 

## ii. Instructions for the rest of this assignment
The purpose of this portion of the assignment is to get a little experience making R Markdown documents as a way of nicely
formatting output from R code while exploring the datasets from Sheather Ch.1 and learning to generate realizations of random variables (aka "fake data"). Modify this RMarkdown file (STAT_757_Assignment1.Rmd) and compile your document as a PDF (or Word document if you're having LaTeX issuse) and naming it according to
the format SURNAME-FIRSTNAME-Assignment1.pdf, and emailing that PDF to the instructor by the due date listed above.

## 2. Reproduce the plots from Sheather Ch.1 [40 points]

Modify this file so that it reproduces all the output from the R script located at [http://www.stat.
tamu.edu/~sheather/book/docs/rcode/Chapter1.R](http://www.stat.
tamu.edu/~sheather/book/docs/rcode/Chapter1.R). I’ve done the plots for the first dataset for you below. Remember that you will need to
download each of the four data sets from http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~sheather/book/data_sets.php, and set
your working directory (under the “Session” menu in Rstudio) appropriately. (And yes, this really is as easy
as copying the blocks of R code for each dataset into this document into the appropriate places!)
Need help? First, see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. Especially the resources under Learning More
(http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/#learning-more). 

Below are the plots that appear in Chapter 1 of the textbook. They were created from the R script <http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~sheather/book/docs/rcode/Chapter1.R> and the data files at <http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~sheather/book/data_sets.php>.

attach(kicker) ## THIS IS NOT USUALLY RECOMMENDED, ASK ME IN CLASS WHY NOT.

## 3. Generating fake data [30 points]

## 3.1 Generate 100 random variates from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation of 100. Summarize and plot the data. (Set a seed to make it reproducible).
```{r}
  set.seed(5)
  x<-rnorm(100,mean=0,sd=100)
  summary(x)
  plot(x)

```





## 3.2 Generate 1000 random variates from a beta distribution with the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ both equal to 2. Summarize and plot the data. (Set a seed to make it reproducible).

```{r}
set.seed=10
var_beta<-rbeta(1000,2,2)
summary(var_beta)
plot(var_beta)

```




## 3.3 Generate 10000 random variates from a binomial distribution with the parameters $n=10$ and $p=0.2$. Summarize and plot the data. (Set a seed to make it reproducible).

```{r}
set.seed=15
var_bino<-rbinom(10000,10,0.2)
summary(var_bino)
plot(var_bino)
```
