## Instructions [20 points]

Modify this file to provide responses to the Ch.8 Exercises in @sheather2009. You can find some helpful code here: [http://www.stat.
tamu.edu/~sheather/book/docs/rcode/Chapter8.R](http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~sheather/book/docs/rcode/Chapter8.R). Also address the project milestones indicated below. Please email **both** your .Rmd (or roxygen .R) and one of the following either .HTML, .PDF, or .DOCX using the format SURNAME-FIRSTNAME-Assignment8.Rmd and SURNAME-FIRSTNAME-Assignment8.pdf.

#### Ans:  a)
When we observe the model 8.6 from the plots, we see that:
1) the plot of HeartDisease Vs x1 and HeartDisease Vs x4 are not adequately fit, and
2) The variates x1 and x4 can be observed to be skewed from the Gaussian Kernel Density estimate plot.
Hence, we need to address these issues in the current model.

Therefore, we could say that the model is not valid.


#### b) Ans:
As already mentioned from a, systolic blood pressure and obesity are skewed in our dataset. Thus we shall add log(x1) and log(x4) in our model.


#### c) Ans:
After the addition of the new variables in the model, we observe that the marginal model plots of HeartDisease vs x1 and x4 have improved and are not much accurately fit. Also, the log(x1) and log(x4) are also accurately fit with each their corresponding marginals. Apart from these, all other variable are fit. Also, Linear predictor is also fit properly. 
Hence, we can say that this model is valid.
Going a step further, we could infact analyse the interaction term between x1 and x4. ALso we could perform analysis of deviance to remove redundant term( x1 and logx1) and improve the model.

#### d) Ans:
The coefficient of x3 is 0.941 in model 8.7.
It can be interpreted as, the patients with family history of heart disease is e(0.941)=2.563 times more prone to heart disease compared to those patients with no history of heart disease in their family.
