## Instructions [20 points]

Modify this file to provide responses to the Ch.5 Exercises in @sheather2009. You can find some helpful code here: [http://www.stat.
tamu.edu/~sheather/book/docs/rcode/Chapter5.R](http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~sheather/book/docs/rcode/Chapter5.R). Also address the project milestones indicated below. Please email **both** your .Rmd (or roxygen .R) and one of the following either .HTML, .PDF, or .DOCX using the format SURNAME-FIRSTNAME-Assignment5.Rmd and SURNAME-FIRSTNAME-Assignment5.pdf.

## Choose either Exercise 5.4.2 or 5.4.3. Respond to all parts posed. [60 points]

Here, we want to model the response variable, Y which is percentage of students repeating first grade, bases on a continuous predictor, X, which is percentage of low-income students, and a dummy variable year.

We should start with Unrelated regression lines as:

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + e $$ when year=0 


$$ Y= \beta_0 + \beta_2 + (\beta_1 + \beta_3)x + e $$ when year = 1

where,
Y= percentage of students repeating first grade
X= percentage of low income students
year= dummy variable (1=2004, 0=1994)

Let us perfrom regression analysis on the data. Let us first plot thed data. 
```{r}

houston <- read.csv("F:/unr/4th sem/applied regression analysis/Assignments/HW5/HoustonChronicle.csv",header=TRUE)
attach(houston)

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(X.Low.income.students[Year==2004],X.Repeating.1st.Grade[Year==2004],pch=c("2"),col=c("black"),ylab="X.Repeating.1st.Grade",xlab="Percentage Low income students")
points(X.Low.income.students[Year==1994],X.Repeating.1st.Grade[Year==1994],pch=c("1"),col=c("red"))

#par(mfrow=c(1,1))
#plot(houston$LowIncome[Year==2004],houston$Repeating[Year==2004], pch=c("2"),col=c("black"),ylab="Repeating 1st Grade",xlab="Percentage Low income students")
#points(houston$LowIncome[Year==1994],houston$Repeating[Year==1994],pch=c("1"),col=c("red"))

```
We do not see much effect of year(dummy variable) on the percentage of repeating students. 



The output from R is as follows.

```{r}
#Regression output 
mfull<-lm(X.Repeating.1st.Grade~X.Low.income.students + Year + Year: X.Low.income.students)
summary(mfull)

```

Note that none of the regresison coefficients are highly significant.
Thus, we can use our final model as
$$ Percentage\_Repeating\_1st\_Grade = 80.95 -3.73 * Percentage\_Low\_Income $$ 

when year=1994.
and, 

$$ Percentage\_Repeating\_1st\_Grade= 80.95-0.038  + (-3.03+.001)x = 80.912 -3.029 * Percentage\_Low\_Income $$

 when year = 2004.
 
 
 Now, lets test for the analysis of covariance.
 
 The fit for the reduced model is given below:
 
```{r}
 mreduced <- lm(X.Repeating.1st.Grade~X.Low.income.students)
 summary(mreduced)

```



As expected there is very little evidence that the two models are different.


a) We can see from the negative coefficient of Percentage_Low_Income, that an increase in the percentage of low income students is negatively associated with an increase in percentage of students repeating first grade.

b) To find this let us develop regression models for year 1994 and 2004 seperately.
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(X.Low.income.students[Year==2004],X.Repeating.1st.Grade[Year==2004],pch=c("2"),col=c("red"),ylab="X.Repeating.1st.Grade",xlab="Percentage Low income students")
#points(X.Low.income.students[Year==1994],X.Repeating.1st.Grade[Year==1994],pch=c("1"),col=c("red"))

model4<-lm(X.Repeating.1st.Grade[Year==2004]~X.Low.income.students[Year==2004])
summary(model4)

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(X.Low.income.students[Year==1994],X.Repeating.1st.Grade[Year==1994],pch=c("1"),col=c("black"),ylab="X.Repeating.1st.Grade",xlab="Percentage Low income students")
#points(X.Low.income.students[Year==1994],X.Repeating.1st.Grade[Year==1994],pch=c("1"),col=c("red"))

model1<-lm(X.Repeating.1st.Grade[Year==1994]~X.Low.income.students[Year==1994])
summary(model1)


```
The two models are as follows:
y=2.88 + 0.07 x, for year= 2004
y= 3.27 + 0.06 x , for year=1994

Since the intercepts are almost same and slope is also similar, we cannot say that there has been an increase in the percentage of the students repeating first grade between 1994 and 2004.




c)
```{r}
 anova(mreduced,mfull)

```

The anova() command clearly shows that removing the year does not significantly affect the fit of the model (F=0.2531, p=0.776). So, there is no difference between the association between the percentage of students repeating first grade and percentage of low-income students between 1994 and 2004.

 

## Project milestones [20 points]

1. Perform an exploratory data analysis:
 * Numerically summarize the variables.
 * Make plots and explore relationships between variables.
 * Identify any strange points or anything else that doesn't make sense.
2. Begin to think about how to model the relationships in your data.
